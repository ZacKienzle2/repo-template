/**
 * Conventional Commits 1.0.0 enforcement.
 *
 * @commitlint/config-conventional already implements the specification, and
 * its own defaults were read rather than assumed: type-enum carries the same
 * eleven types, subject-case rejects the same four cases, and type-case,
 * subject-full-stop and header-max-length are identical to what this file used
 * to restate. Every one of those overrides was a hand-maintained copy that
 * would drift the moment upstream changed, so they are gone.
 *
 * What is left is the two places this project genuinely differs. The package
 * sets the leading-blank rules to warning; a message that runs the subject
 * into the body is malformed rather than untidy, so both are errors here.
 *
 * An ES module because wagoid/commitlint-github-action, which runs this in
 * CI, loads .mjs and documents that .js and .cjs are not read.
